# GNN-Music-Classification

An approach to Music Genre Classification through the application of Graph Neural Networks. 

[Read the Paper](docs/GNN_Final_Paper.pdf)

Music genre classification is a common application of deep learning and generally uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to identify patterns in audio features. We decide to explore Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their practical applications for music genre classification. Using the GTZAN dataset, we utilize a Dense Neural Network and CNN for benchmarking, and compare the results and trade-offs.
